# vagueTime.js

[![Build status][ci-image]][ci-status]

A tiny JavaScript library
that formats precise time differences
as a vague/fuzzy time,
e.g. '3 months ago', 'just now' or 'in 2 hours'.
Supports English, German, French, Dutch and Danish phrases.

## Why would I want that?

Displaying precise dates and times
can give a website a formal and officious feel.
Using fuzzy or vague time phrases
like 'just now' or '2 days ago'
can contribute to a much friendlier interface.

vagueTime.js provides a small, clean API
for translating timestamps
into those user-friendly phrases,
heavily supported by unit tests.
Vague time strings can be returned
in English, German, French, Dutch or Danish.

## What alternative libraries are there?

* [date.js][date];
* [moment.js][moment];
* [xdate];
* [countdown.js][countdown].

## How tiny is it?

The library can be built
with support for any combination
of English, German, French, Dutch and Danish languages.
Single-language builds
are typically around
4.3 kb unminified with comments,
1.3 kb minified
or 0.7 kb minified + gzipped.

The largest build,
containing all supported languages,
is 6.8 kb unminified with comments, 2.3 kb minified
or 1 kb minified + gzipped.

## How do I install it?

Any of the following will do:

```
npm install vague-time

jam install vague-time

bower install vague-time

component install philbooth/vagueTime.js

git clone git@github.com:philbooth/vagueTime.js.git
```

## How do I use it?

### Loading the library

If you are running in
[Node.js][node],
[Browserify]
or another CommonJS-style
environment,
you can `require`
vagueTime.js like so:

```javascript
var vagueTime = require('vague-time');
```

It also the supports
the AMD-style format
preferred by [Require.js][require]:

```javascript
require.config({
    paths: {
        vague-time: 'vagueTime.js/lib/vagueTime'
    }
});

require([ 'vague-time' ], function (vagueTime) {
});
```

The default module
contains all of the supported languages,
if you want to load a custom build
you must make sure
that you reference that build explicitly.

If you are
including vagueTime.js
with an HTML `<script>` tag,
or neither of the above environments
are detected,
the interface will be globally available
as `vagueTime`.

### Calling the exported functions

vagueTime.js exports a single public function, `get`,
which returns a vague time string
based on the argument(s) that you pass it.

The arguments are passed as properties
 on a single options object:

* `from`:
  timestamp or `Date` instance denoting the origin point from which the vague time will be calculated.
  Defaults to `Date.now()`.
* `to`:
  timestamp or `Date` instance denoting the target point to which the vague time will be calculated.
  Defaults to `Date.now()`.
* `units`:
   string denoting the units that the `from` and `to` timestamps are specified in.
  May be `'s'` for seconds or `'ms'` for milliseconds.
  Defaults to `'ms'`.
  This property has no effect
  when `from` and `to` are `Date` instances
  rather than timestamps.
* `lang`:
  string denoting the output language.
  May be `'en'` (English),
  `'de'` (German),
  `'fr'` (French),
  `'nl'` (Dutch)
  or `'da'` (Danish).
  The default is set by the build options.

Essentially,
if `to` is less than `from`,
the returned vague time will indicate
some point in the past.
If `to` is greater than `from`,
it will indicate
some point in the future.

### Examples

```javascript
vagueTime.get({
    from: 60,
    to: 0,
    units: 's'
}); // returns '1 minute ago'

vagueTime.get({
    from: 0,
    to: 60,
    units: 's'
}); // returns 'in 1 minute'

vagueTime.get({
    from: 7200,
    to: 0,
    units: 's'
}); // returns '2 hours ago'

vagueTime.get({
    from: 0,
    to: 7200,
    units: 's',
    lang: 'de'
}); // returns 'vor 2 Stunden'

vagueTime.get({
    from: new Date(2015, 0, 3),
    to: new Date(2014, 11, 31),
    lang: 'de'
}); // returns 'in 3 Tagen'

vagueTime.get({
    from: 0,
    to: 259200,
    units: 's',
    lang: 'fr'
}); // returns 'il y a 3 jours'

vagueTime.get({
    from: new Date(2015, 0, 27),
    to: new Date(2014, 11, 31),
    lang: 'fr'
}); // returns 'dans 4 semaines'
```

## How do I build it?

The build environment relies on
Node.js,
[NPM],
[JSHint],
[Commander]
[Mocha],
[Chai] and
[UglifyJS].
Assuming that you already have Node/NPM set up,
you just need to run `npm install`
to install all of the dependencies as listed in `package.json`.

You can then lint the source module
with the command `npm run lint`.

You can run the standard build process
with the command `npm run build`
or run a custom build using the build script:

```
./build.js -l <comma-separated list of language codes> -d <default language code>
```

The unit tests are in `test/vagueTime.js`.
You can run them with the command `npm test`.
To run the tests in a web browser,
open `test/vagueTime.html`.
